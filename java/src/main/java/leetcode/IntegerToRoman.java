/**
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D
 * and M.
 *
 * Symbol Value I 1 V 5 X 10 L 50 C 100 D 500 M 1000
 *
 * For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added
 * together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number
 * twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right.
 * However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is
 * written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four.
 * The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There
 * are six instances where subtraction is used:
 *
 * I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. X can be placed
 * before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. C can be placed before D (500)
 * and M (1000) to make 400 and 900. Given an integer, convert it to a roman
 * numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.
